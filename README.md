# YouRef
 * A SpringBoot application similar to JabRef for managing bibliographies.
 
 * Allows the user to enter author, title, year, and journal to add a new entry 
   to the bibliography collection.
 
 * Displays a list of all the bibliographies in the database.
 * Uses MySQL database for data storage. Just create a schema in your  
   MySQL instance, and make sure you configure application.properties correctly.
   Note: Currently, the default schema name is springbootfirstapp.
         By default, MySQL port is 6608, user name is root, and password is root.
   	     See application.properties if you wish to change any of these values.
  
 * Allows the user to modify or delete an existing bibliography.
  
 * Search feature has been implemented. Type a word and hit Enter, and any 
   entry containing such word will be displayed in a table.
